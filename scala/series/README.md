# Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

- 012
- 123
- 234

And the following 4-digit series:

- 0123
- 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

For more detailed info about the Scala track see the [help
page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-scala.html).
